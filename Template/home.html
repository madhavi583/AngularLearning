I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life

        </div>
        <ul>
     <li>Donâ€™t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity</li>
        <li>On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there </li>
        <li>But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe</li>
        <li>I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me</li>
